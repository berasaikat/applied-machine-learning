decision analytics project set help business face massive uncertainty kind decision analysis help people explore problem redesign decision making process increase chance making right choice example imagine biotechnology company decide whether put sale enter strategic relationship continue go alone option lead value enhancing value destroying scenario work client firstly understand challenge

sometimes challenge technology intensive field however found manager often scientist quite willing describe main source risk ass probability risky event may may occur kind risky decision making relate
