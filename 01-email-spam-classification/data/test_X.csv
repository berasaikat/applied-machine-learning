political negotiating skill pressure parent company utility pas something le full billion debt pg e socal edison already round one legal battle designed let raise electricity rate enough recover debt accumulated since august last year puc refused let raise price even electricity price soared court said deregulation law crystal clear two utility repaid called stranded cost free begin charging whatever needed charge consumer cover cost acquiring power although utility case judge stayed order february th state government request deadline approach intense new negotiating round way one hand political official know ultimate political cover higher electric price court made hand also know immediate full compliance court order would force electricity rate top natural gas bill soared since last year utility company playing card aggressively negotiation scope shape final bailout wait court put order effect mid february even bankruptcy emerge quickly easily one tactic state political
