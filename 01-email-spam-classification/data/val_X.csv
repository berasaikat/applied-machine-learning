mar wg meeting hello appended find summary idea people contributed since caida began get metric wg started material already appeared metric mailing list older material come personal email posting give u idea think able attend wg meeting san jose thursday mar like spend time morning getting know attendee interest experience making internet measurement suggest good way would group give short minute response time get even interesting need able see traffic one direction client server get fairly accurate round trip time client server irrespective far away client measurement host tcp three way handshake connection establishment see opening syn wait client ack server syn ack client server round trip time think actually already done could also potentially try correlate dns query tcp connection perhaps determining probability given environment host initiating tcp connection host received record track various application level response time personally love lot data ratio dns response time tcp transfer time http connection even measurement make attempt discern constitutes web transaction user full page usually many tcp connection anyway think fairly interesting thing measure simple technique simple one may interesting thing could digging payload highly utilized application tcp nightmare perfomance wise basic infrastructure thing dns udp probably cover open udp protocol without incurring performance penalty would make completely unusable snmp example application limited network service provider would find round trip time information snmp packet network management station agent useful think rudimentary thing tcp well also think site would interested rudimentary information example weighted traffic round trip time distribution tcp traffic network communicated say granularity give site notion close talk frequently little work could probably make reasonable bandwidth estimate every end network see tcp data could certainly get reasonable number maximum observed bandwidth method also decouple measurement traffic know value think significant active probers run host decoupled actual measurement timestamps coming kernel space bpf thinking long time eventually like skitter tool able use tcp packet probing need thing like ip firewall code properly time non blocking connects count passive tool see syn syn ack use tcp port round trip time measurement trick kernel sending tcp packet raw socket need feedback passive tool tracing like skitter need know reply seen hop destination reached difficult simple bytestream oriented ipc sufficient going like idea proposed others maybe funded point tracking instrumenting freenix tcp ip stack lot useful information could pulled stack eventually someone going come piece information desirable enough someone want stack instrumented somewhere currently implemented full blown metering system like rtfm think interim lot thing could using libpcap local machine non promiscuous user space safe easy implement test benefit user likely tangible well understood relationship workstation understood particularly true u network expertise least plausible find correlation measurement user experience fairly short period time helping u hone useful even find weak correlation whatever reason correlation exists people interested helping development something use personally essentially guaranteed see traffic direction personally interested trying find small set information correlate user experience take terabyte disk processor deal data say desktop anyway random thought hard part moment thinking useful generalization infrastructure support cindy bickerstaff responded starting capture ms window size negotiation timeit server get idea typical usual wonder daniel code could various traffic monitoring point caida data could used fill parameter trying model passive data collected since typical web page many element single client server first base page give starting idea expect subsequent element like repeat measurement path short time interval since strong time day week effect volume perf short duration data collection single web page incl element might give option modeling maybe getting better estimate packet loss really enjoyed joining e e interest group idea factor reference past modeling attempt e g mathis et al paper ack bulk transfer focus paul krumviede highlighted difficulty agreeing detail measure common metric like availability reliability throughput latency example throughput since proposed measured using tcp file transfer random data one concern latency get measured many customer service would large business measuring customer end kbps circuit almost certain drive end end latency measurement beyond defined bound measuring within point provider network might show figure customer could never see compromise define throughput metric ocurring access link load bit rate one measure given discussion recognized prelude imposition minimal slas part
