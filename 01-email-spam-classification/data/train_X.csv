business novel might hidden respect real option analysis much closer reality traditional valuation exactly classic way valuing future business base calculation single discounted cashflow projected activity really take account way scenario change fact manager react situation unfold mentioned earlier option kill project business early point upside pilot project yield exciting result might allow invest quickly reach revenue generating position much shorter time original business plan allows value future business really need look cashflows might arise number scenario realistic project get green light bet manager taking kind decision ground time challenging part mapping decision analysis tree modelling link variable decision tree something particular strength also tricky know worthwhile add detail better draw back recent erisk interview rick buy chief risk officer enron said two year enron experimented real option concept found limited zero use slight air cynicism real option business today strange enron would profess attitude year ago widely reported used real option valuation support profitable purchase decision apparently bought cheaply older generator u generated electricity high cost knew could mothball year switch electricity price sufficiently high nevertheless customer point view might much hype methodology one problem application real option technology perhaps many people trying tweak reality conform perfect model better aim something pragmatic clearly improves decision time one pharmaceutical company worked recently worked together improve valuation analysis moving single discounted cash flow methodology one took account rather small set business scenario would shocked academic consultant undeniable improvement original approach think financial institution picking field applied energy industry year might something relative stability banking world recently relatively high margin banking line enjoyed also industry energy pharmaceutical tend people engineering science background dynamic modelling decision based methodology originally dreamed help engineer design electrical electronic system approach quite distinct black scholes option analysis banking world familiar black scholes approach difficult apply real option context everything depends assumption put black scholes model real option approach hand sense

speculative investment mean internet investment recently worked major dutch bank arrived late internet game made considerable number investment even b b business model question mark hanging many b c business already water wanted work investment might contain real value situation case ranking priority helping bank make sense could turn decision making chaos rather sophisticated valuation case whether internet investment killed problem whether continued funding take priority budget demand major upgrade existing business practical question answered somehow area financial institution seem accessible approach yes example think help work value associated various approach marketing new bank business line moment many bank chasing high net worth individual always clear kind individual particular bank decide pursue bank might regional industry advantage already one particular area example music business people churn rate associated kind customer profitability associated customer segment time cost benefit advantage bank sector outweigh disadvantage weighing kind complex problem one thing lead depends another decision real option analysis good way rigorously backtesting validating real option valuation honesty really problem time option exercised many variable surrounding changed difficult compare original analysis thing turn however value analysis come final number value asset x also providing thorough process outsider point view understanding source value short bit clearer thinking real option important rarely cited communication shareholder equity analyst battle still convince company use real option valuation significant part internal analysis even major company oil gas pharmaceutical sector idea taken root internally seems lot reluctance use external
