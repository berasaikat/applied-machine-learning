really help business day day balancing risk reward yann hold ph degree engineering economic system department stanford university studied apply engineering decision design analysis wider economic social business issue worked consultant applying decision analysis methodology problem included consumer decision making innovative product electrical vehicle joining team partner written widely application real option particularly field life science technology e business special interest relationship risk assessment validation risk data financial valuation would sum approach business decision analytics project set help business face massive uncertainty kind decision analysis help people explore problem redesign decision making process increase chance making right choice example imagine biotechnology company decide whether put sale enter strategic relationship continue go alone option lead value enhancing value destroying scenario work client firstly understand challenge assumption associated likely business development scenario secondly help identify decision would help protect increase value technology company quantifying technical regulatory commercial risk sometimes challenge technology intensive field however found manager often scientist quite willing describe main source risk ass probability risky event may may occur kind risky decision making relate real option valuation say value asset decide might use mean form opinion value asset must explore important decision likely face significant impact value asset decision analysis help define business problem uncover stream inter related choice effect real option example company trying decide whether invest risky project option pull plug investment early stage pilot project give poor showing real option reduces riskiness increase potential value original business plan real option decision analysis really close one another believe real option valuation find decision analysis useful mean often decision analysis help manager identify key risk strategic decision attach weight show clearly interact many company risk discovery valuable part exercise real option theory criticised recently well realistic practical approach valuation important hold unrealistic hope real option approach valuation exciting methodology also sometimes reasonable way tackling practical problem example firm sell asset firm might make independent valuation asset legal corporate governance reason many business today asset simply cannot valued traditional way difficult link cashflows cashflows might exist business novel might hidden respect real option analysis much closer reality traditional valuation exactly classic way valuing future business base calculation single discounted cashflow projected activity really take account way scenario change fact manager react situation unfold mentioned earlier option kill project business early point upside pilot project yield exciting result might allow invest quickly reach revenue generating position much shorter time original business plan allows value future business really need look cashflows might arise number scenario realistic project get green light bet manager taking kind decision ground time challenging part mapping decision analysis tree modelling link variable decision tree something particular strength also tricky know worthwhile add detail better draw back recent erisk interview rick buy chief risk officer enron said two year enron experimented real option concept found limited zero use slight air cynicism real option business today strange enron would profess attitude year ago widely reported used real option valuation support profitable purchase decision apparently bought cheaply older generator u generated electricity high cost knew could mothball year switch electricity price sufficiently high nevertheless customer point view might much hype methodology one problem application real option technology perhaps many people trying tweak reality conform perfect model better aim something pragmatic clearly improves decision time one pharmaceutical company worked recently worked together improve valuation analysis moving single discounted cash flow methodology one took account rather small set business scenario would shocked academic consultant undeniable improvement original approach think financial institution picking field applied energy industry year might something relative stability banking world recently relatively high margin banking line enjoyed also industry energy pharmaceutical tend people engineering science background dynamic modelling decision based methodology originally dreamed help engineer design electrical electronic system approach quite distinct black scholes option analysis banking world familiar black scholes approach difficult apply real option context everything depends assumption put black scholes model real option approach hand sense

speculative investment mean internet investment recently worked major dutch bank arrived late internet game made considerable number investment even b b business model question mark hanging many b c business already water wanted work investment might contain real value situation case ranking priority helping bank make sense could turn decision making chaos rather sophisticated valuation case whether internet investment killed problem whether continued funding take priority budget demand major upgrade existing business practical question answered somehow area financial institution seem
