# Transfer Learning for Image and Text Data

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating transfer learning techniques for image and text data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers, respectively.

## Notebooks

### 1. Transfer Learning for image data using CNN 
- Colab Notebook: [**transfer-learning-for-image-data-using-cnn.ipynb**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1teTjN0m5ymcUOgTXmSXui9cG9_cMLYXT?usp=sharing)      
  This notebook demonstrates transfer learning for image data using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. It includes the following steps:    
  - Setting up necessary libraries and dependencies
  - Loading and preprocessing image data
  - Defining a custom dataset class for Chicken-Duck classification
  - Creating train, validation, and test datasets and data loaders
  - Fine-tuning the MobileNetV2 model
  - Evaluating the model on the test set
  - Plotting training and validation curves

### 2. Transfer Learning for text data using Transformer
- Kaggle Notebook: [**transfer-learning-for-text-data-using-transformer.ipynb**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kinjalghosh/transfer-learning-for-text-data-using-transformer)        
  This notebook showcases transfer learning for text data using a pre-trained BERT model. It covers the following steps:     
  - Loading and preprocessing sentiment analysis dataset
  - Creating PyTorch data loaders for training and testing
  - Loading the pre-trained BERT-based sentiment classification model
  - Training the model with AdamW optimizer
  - Evaluating the model on the test set
  - Plotting training loss and accuracy curves
